#Code Book
The following detials the changes made to the variable names in the raw data. as ewell as a description of the tidy data
##Variables
The following abreviations were expanded out:
-t at the begining of a variable name became time
-f at the begining became frequency
-Acc became accelerometer
-Gyro became gyroscope
-Mag became magnitude  
I did not change std or Freq since it is clear what those abrivations mean.  

I also put '.' between each word and made all the letters lowercase for ease of reading and use.
Please refer to the features_info.txt for more information about the variables.
##Tidy Data

The tidy data is the average of each mean and stardard deviation of all the variables in the original data set broken out by  
subject and activity
